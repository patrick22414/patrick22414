## I'm looking for a PhD position in Reinforcement Learning!

(Autumn 2022. UK-based preferred but not necessary)

My interests are in (multi-agent) **reinforcement learning and games**. I want my PhD subject to be a continuation of my MSc dissertation (see below), as I have really enjoyed working on reinforcement learning.

## I'm currently ...

- A master's student of Advanced Computing at King's College London, about to graduate in Jan 2022. My master's dissertation is **_Multi-Agent Cooperation in Hanabi with Policy Optimisation_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/hanabi_project)), supervised by Dr Josh Murphy.

- I graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China in 2020. My bachelor's thesis is about **computer vision on a drone** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/drone-projects)), supervised by Dr. D. J. Lee at Brigham Young University, Utah, US.

## I have worked on ...

- **Neural architecture search** and **object detection** during my internship at Novauto Inc, Beijing.

- Open-source neural architecture search framework `aw_nas` ([repo](https://github.com/walkerning/aw_nas)).

- **Object detection** on drones during my internship at Zerotech Inc, Beijing.

- **Text detection** and **key information extraction** as part of ICDAR 2019 ([repo](https://github.com/zzzDavid/ICDAR-2019-SROIE)) (the repo is surprisingly popular, I don't know why). My partners are [Niansong Zhang](https://github.com/zzzDavid) and [Shengjie Xiu](https://github.com/Michael-Xiu).

- A computer vision library with **OpenCV** and **C#** but it's close-source.

### Some HTML/JavaScript side projects:

- Covid-19 data visualisation ([website](https://patrick22414.github.io/coursework-sdv/), [repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/coursework-sdv)) (coursework at KCL).

- wows-view ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/wows-view)) is a data-viewing website for the game World of Worships, using Vue and Vercel.
