<!-- I now have a [personal blog site](https://patrick22414.substack.com/), currently in **BETA** cuz I'm too lazy. -->

<!-- ## I'm looking for a PhD position in Reinforcement Learning!

(Autumn 2022. UK-based preferred but not necessary)

My interests are in (multi-agent) **reinforcement learning and games**. I want my PhD subject to be a continuation of my MSc dissertation (see below), as I have really enjoyed working on reinforcement learning. -->

## I'm currently ...

- A MSc student studying Advanced Computing at King's College London, about to graduate in Jan 2022. My master's dissertation is **_Multi-Agent Cooperation in Hanabi with Policy Optimisation_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/hanabi_project)), supervised by Dr Josh Murphy.
- I graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China in 2020. My bachelor's project is **_Vision-based Autonomous Aerial Object Capturing and Chasing with UAVs_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/drone-projects)), supervised by Dr. D. J. Lee at Brigham Young University, Utah, US.

## I have worked on ...

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Neural architecture search** and **object detection** during my internship at Novauto Tech, Beijing.
- Open-source neural architecture search framework `aw_nas` ([repo](https://github.com/walkerning/aw_nas)).
- **Object detection** on drones during my internship at Zerotech Drones, Beijing.
- **Text detection** and **key information extraction** as part of ICDAR 2019 ([repo](https://github.com/zzzDavid/ICDAR-2019-SROIE)) (the repo is surprisingly popular, I don't know why), with my friends [Niansong Zhang](https://github.com/zzzDavid) and [Shengjie Xiu](https://github.com/Michael-Xiu).
- A computer vision library with **OpenCV** and **C#** but it's close-source.

## I want to learn ...

- More about reinforcement learning!
- New programming languages, Go and Rust!
- New languages! Here is my plan: Mandarin --> English -(I'm here)-> Japanese --> Spanish.

### Some HTML/JavaScript side projects:

- Covid-19 data visualisation ([website](https://patrick22414.github.io/coursework-sdv/), [repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/coursework-sdv)) (coursework at KCL).
- wows-view ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/wows-view)) is a data-viewing website for the game World of Worships, using Vue and Vercel.
