# Hi, name's Songyi ü¶©

I am an applied scientist working for [AWS ProServe](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/). My specialisation is in AI/ML, optimisation, and also infrastructure/web dev.

I have an master's degree in **Advanced Computing** at **King's College London**. My master's dissertation is **_Multi-Agent Cooperation in Hanabi with Policy Optimisation_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/hanabi_project)), supervised by Dr Josh Murphy.

Before that, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in English Translation) from **Sun Yat-Sen University** (Guangzhou, China) in 2020. My bachelor's dissertation is **_Vision-based Autonomous Aerial Object Capturing and Chasing with UAVs_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/drone-projects)), jointly supervised by Dr D. J. Lee from Brigham Young University (Utah, US), and Dr Dong Zhang from SYSU.

I currently reside in London, UK, near the prime meridian.

## I have worked on ...

> (*in rough reverse chronological order*)

- AWS cloud, especially MLOps.
- Graph Neural Network.
- Time Series Forecasting (wouldn't recommand).
- Grafana and SQL.
- Talking to people, a.k.a. consulting.
- Optimisation for operations research, specifically [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization).
- Reinforcement Learning.
- Neural Architecture Search and Object Detection. Our main project is an open-source NAS framework [aw_nas](https://github.com/walkerning/aw_nas).
- Text Detection and Key Information Extraction as part of ICDAR 2019 ([repo](https://github.com/zzzDavid/ICDAR-2019-SROIE)), with my friends [@Niansong Zhang](https://github.com/zzzDavid) and [@Shengjie Xiu](https://github.com/Michael-Xiu).
- Computer Vision with OpenCV (okay) and C# (weird).

## Side projects:

- See pinned repos below.
- Go graphics stuff, like the [Game of Life](https://github.com/patrick22414/life-goes) and [L-system](https://github.com/patrick22414/rewrite).
- Covid-19 data visualisation ([demo](https://patrick22414.github.io/coursework-sdv/), [repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/coursework-sdv)) with D3.js.

## Trivia

How to pronounce "Songyi"?
- Like "song-EE". In Chinese/Pinyin: "Âµ©ÊØÖ/S≈çng-Y√¨". "Patrick" is also welcome but will raise a deprecation warning.

Flamingo?
- Yes, flamingo.
