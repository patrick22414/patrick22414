# Hi, name's Songyi / Patrick ðŸ¦©

I am a new graduate at [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/) (ProServe) from Sep 2022. I am learning to become a consultant at AWS.

Before this, I was a MSc student in Advanced Computing at King's College London until Jan 2022. My master's final project is **_Multi-Agent Cooperation in Hanabi with Policy Optimisation_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/hanabi_project)), supervised by Dr Josh Murphy.

And before that, I graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China) in 2020. My bachelor's final project is **_Vision-based Autonomous Aerial Object Capturing and Chasing with UAVs_** ([repo](https://github.com/patrick22414/drone-projects)), jointly supervised by Dr D. J. Lee from Brigham Young University (Utah, US), and Dr Dong Zhang from SYSU.
