### I'm currently working on ...

I'm currently working at Novauto Inc, Beijing as an intern. I'm doing [Neural Architecture Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_architecture_search)-related projects, and I also help adding bits and pieces to the open-source NAS framework [aw_nas](https://github.com/walkerning/aw_nas).

### I'm currently learning ...

Work / Study:

- Neural Architecture Search

Side projects:

- I'm learning [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but it's kind of hard :(
- Privacy-preserving AI and Federated Learning. I believe it will be a prominent field in future AI research.
- [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/). Because I feel it's the only JavaScript-related stuff with some sanity left (yes, I predominantly code in Python).

Side projects that have been abandoned (but I might pick them up, might):

- [wows-view](https://github.com/patrick22414/wows-view) is a data-viewing website for the game World of Worships, written in Vue, hosted on Vercel

### I have worked on ...

- Text detection and information extraction on ICDAR 2019 ([codebase](https://github.com/zzzDavid/ICDAR-2019-SROIE)) (the repo is surprisingly popular, I donno why)
- My bachelor's thesis is about computer vision on a drone ([codebase](https://github.com/patrick22414/drone-projects))
- A Computer Vision library with OpenCV but it's close-source
